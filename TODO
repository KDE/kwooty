TODO list for next releases :
=============================

- Password handling with kwallet option

- After Decoding, set a dedicated icon for files that need to be verified (crc ko or missing parts), for yenc files only (uu have to verified in any cases due to lack of crc checking)

- Compute and display verify % progression

- MultiServer support (active and failover) => also think to forecast an updated interface later (for instance, for each servers being able to display connection numbers, download speed, statistics, ...)

- Plugin : statistics management(download by day / month / year)

- Plugin : Bandwidth throttle and scheduler

- Plugin : Send mail when a job is finished (lib to write)
